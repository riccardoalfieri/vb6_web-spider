Title: Phenix Spider - A complete Internet Spider!
Description: As a person at college who has a lot of time on his hands I decided to make a web spider to go though pages getting either email address's or listing the address's of pages in which a search paramanter was found.
Completely coded myself I am quite pleased with the result, if you find any code which is userful feel free to use it, remember to vote! :)
